{"Question": "<image>\nQuestion: Humans can find corresponding points for the same action between different objects. For instance, if a person uses a pot versus a hammer to \"Mash Pound\", then the handle of the pot will be the corresponding point to the handle of the hammer because they serve the same function for the action -- to hold; and the bottom of the pot will be the corresponding point to the face of the hammer because they both mash the other object.\nGiven the following two images, a reference point is annotated on the first image, labeled with REF. You are given multiple red-circled points on the right image, choices of \"A, B, C, D\" are drawn beside each circle. Select from the choices on the second image and find the corresponding point for the reference point, if we use both items for the action: \"Lift Something\".
